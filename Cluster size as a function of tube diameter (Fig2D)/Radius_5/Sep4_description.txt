This was done for all interaction strength J = 3kT. 
Initial Cluster Size [140, 180, 230] for each radiuses [21,24,27] (this is the number of lattice sites of the circumference )
Per file: 2 runs, 15 hours per run -> total of 30 hours
Per concentration per radius 12 files
So total of 24 samples for each concentration per radius.
testing at 10 different concentrations  to (e.g. for the circumferene = 12 case, the N_particles tested are 30,40,50,...,120) per file.
Done for 3 radiuses
120 files per radius. (12 files x 10 N_particles tested)

total of 360 files running for over a days.
